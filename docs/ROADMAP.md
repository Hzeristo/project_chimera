## Sealed Phases

### Phase I — Foundation
**Goal:** System never crashes silently. Configuration has single source of truth. Logs are greppable.

| Milestone | Deliverable | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| M1 Error Handling | LLM timeout protection (`generate_raw_text` + outer 120s watchdog), per-tool timeout, `web_search` async via `to_thread`, `BaseException` black hole eliminated, FastAPI streaming exception capture | `{commit}` |
| M2 Configuration Unification | `platform.py` / `platform.rs` cross-language path abstraction, `~/.chimera/config.toml` as single truth, `config.example.toml`, multi-LLM slot config (working/wash/router) | `{commit}` |
| M3 Observability Baseline | Uniform Python log format `%(asctime)s \| %(levelname)-8s \| %(name)s \| %(message)s`, bracket-prefix convention `[Oligo]/[Router]/[Tool]/[Wash]/[Final]/[Vault]/[LLM]/[Config]`, SSE event protocol (`bb-stream-chunk`, `bb-sys-event`, `bb-stream-done`) | `{commit}` |

**Accepted partials:** front-end Provider deletion UI dropped — TOML is authoritative.
**Sealed:** 2026-04-XX.

---

### Phase II — Cognition
**Goal:** System knows what to do with tools, has skills, and we know if any of it is actually used.

| Milestone | Deliverable | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| II.A Skill Ecosystem | Six skill JSONs in `~/.chimera/skills/`, `SkillStatsService` writing `~/.chimera/skill_stats.json`, frontend skill card grid with usage / success-rate / avg-tokens | `{commit}` |
| II.B Tool Registry | `search_vault`, `search_vault_attribute`, `obsidian_graph_query`, `web_search`, `arxiv_miner`, `check_task_status`, `daily_paper_pipeline` registered. Gravedigger deferred to Phase IV. | `{commit}` |
| II.C Wash Refinement | Intent-driven `_wash_tool_result` consuming context window, `_BYPASS_WASH_TOOLS` / `_FORCE_WASH_TOOLS` policy split, dual-engine (cheap wash + premium working) | `{commit}` |
| II.D Observability & Metrics | `MetricsService` with system / tool / wash dimensions, persisted to `~/.chimera/metrics.json`, frontend health panel | `{commit}` |
| II.E Dogfooding (Use Week) | Five friction entries logged. Pattern: all five point to "Astrocyte ↔ CLI workflows not bridged." | `{commit}` |

**Sealed:** 2026-05-XX.

---

### Phase III.A — Connection Convergence
**Goal:** Astrocyte becomes the trigger surface for existing CLI workflows.

| Step | Deliverable | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| Step 0: Contamination Fix (S0.1–S0.4) | `_FINAL_GUARDRAIL` block, Router CMD-syntax relaxation, tool whitelist enforcement, code-block-aware CMD regex pre-strip | `{commit}` |
| Step 1: Boundary Audit | Skill / Tool / Lens conceptual boundary documented. Decision: existing 6 "skills" are *disguised lenses*, retain as legacy markers, no refactor | `{commit}` |
| Step 2: Event-Driven Task Progress | `TaskService.event_queue` + `/v1/tasks/stream` SSE channel, Rust `task_stream.rs` with exponential reconnect, Svelte `ActiveTaskPanel` with 0.1s tabular-num timer using local `Date.now()` basis | `{commit}` |
| Step 3: Daily Pipeline Tool | `daily_paper_pipeline(skip_telegram?)` registered, 4-stage progress emission via `start_stage`, idempotent via `audit_log.csv` | `{commit}` |

**Sealed:** 2026-05-XX.

---

### Phase III.B — Middleware & Harness (Functional Seal)
**Goal:** Prompt assembly stops being string concatenation roulette. Tool calling stops being regex prayer.

| Sub-phase | Deliverable | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| III.B.1 Prompt Middleware (MW.0–4) | `PromptComposer` with 9 registered components, stable/dynamic prefix split via `cacheable` flag, `TextSanitizer` three-layer strip (reasoning / tool-syntax-in-visible / message-history-sanitization), `docs/ARCHITECTURE/PROMPT_MIDDLEWARE.md` | `{commit}` |
| III.B.2 Tool Protocol Lite (TP.0–5) | `ToolRegistry` with `ToolSpec` (concurrency_safe, long_running, args_schema, examples), XML `<tool_call>` parsing alongside legacy `<CMD:...>`, 5-rule argument-repair (code fence / quote style / trailing comma / brace wrap / smart quotes), `partition_tool_calls` by concurrency safety, `docs/ARCHITECTURE/TOOL_PROTOCOL.md` | `{commit}` |
| III.B.3 Intent Recognition (IR.0–5) | Tri-tier tool list rendering (verbose/compact/micro under length budget), `<tool_result status=...>` typed wrapper with reflection hints (failure-only), `EMPTY_RESULT` fallback suggestion, `bb-tool-start`/`bb-tool-done` per-call telemetry, `ActiveToolStrip` 0.1s tool-level timer, `xml_structured` renderer reserved for Phase IV PPR injection, `docs/ARCHITECTURE/INTENT_AND_DEGRADATION.md` | `{commit}` |
| III.B.4 Context-Folding | **Deferred indefinitely.** Friction log shows no demand. May surface in Phase IV trajectory reasoning. |
| III.B.5 Memory CRUD | **Merged into Phase IV.** Will design alongside Exocortex K/T/I/D ontology. |
| III.B.6 UI Visualization | **Folded into Phase III.C.** Attachment rendering and message ops handle the visualization needs. |

**Functional seal** rather than full administrative seal — see `ACCEPTED_PARTIALS.md` for trade-offs and `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` for tracked items.
**Sealed:** 2026-05-XX.

## Active Phase

# Phase III.C — Structured Final Contract

**Status:** Sealed — 2026-05-25
**Sealed predecessor:** III.B.3
**Driving frictions:** E3 (tool results unlinkable), E4 (cannot delete messages)

## Mission

让工具调用产物可在前端追溯。BB 的回答能挂载真实文件链接而非编造内容。

## Sprint Sequence

L1 manifest only declares names + one-line goals. Detailed task scope, file lists,
line estimates, and acceptance criteria are generated by sprint-discipline at plan time
based on FC.0 audit findings + current code state.

| Sprint | One-line goal |
|---|---|
| FC.0 | Audit current state of tool-return / artifact / persona / message-delete pipeline |
| FC.1 | Vault tools opt-in to ToolOutput(text, artifacts) |
| FC.2 | Artifact pipeline: backend aggregation → SSE → Tauri → Svelte state |
| FC.3 | Frontend chip rendering + Obsidian open command |
| FC.4 | Persona/Router separation: final_persona_override is FINAL-stage only |
| FC.5 | Message delete UI + persistent state |
| FC.6 | Documentation (FINAL_CONTRACT.md) + E2E smoke |

Dependencies: FC.0 precedes all. FC.4 is parallelizable. Others are roughly sequential
but skill may identify split opportunities at plan time.

## Cross-Sprint Red Lines (apply to all FC sprints)

- ❌ Do NOT introduce dependency on OpenAI structured-output API
- ❌ Do NOT let artifacts influence LLM tool decisions
- ❌ Do NOT let artifacts enter messages payload to LLM
- ❌ Do NOT do rich inline preview in frontend (Phase V territory)

## Hard Sealing Conditions

These MUST Pass to seal Phase III.C:
1. Three vault tools actually return ToolOutput (verified by Grep at seal time)
2. Artifacts NEVER appear in messages sent to LLM (verified by Grep on send paths)
3. Router behavior identical across persona changes (verified by unit test)

## Out of Scope

- Memory CRUD → Phase IV
- Context-Folding → III.B.4 indefinitely deferred
- Trajectory reasoning → emerges from multi-turn ReAct, no infrastructure
- Exocortex retrieval → Phase IV
- Gravedigger → Phase IV (research integration period)

## Completion Signal

用户下次想看深读报告时,在 Astrocyte 点紫色 chip,Obsidian 自动打开。

## Queued

### Phase IV — Exocortex & Memory
- K/T/I/D node ontology (Knowledge / Thought / Insight / Decision)
- PaperMiner → Knowledge Node automation (via Lens output → vault note write)
- Shallow PPR retrieval with pruning + fanout activation (star-expansion for hyperedges, no theoretical purity tax)
- Memory CRUD operators (entity + attribute as RDF triple, LLM-as-judge for conflict resolution)
- Gravedigger (OpenReview-Miner with reuse of `FilterService` + `VaultNoteWriter` + `PaperArchiveAdapter`)
- Trajectory reasoning emerges from PPR-tool multi-turn ReAct (no separate infrastructure)

### Phase V — Horizon (speculative)
- Inspiration mechanics (nightly random walk over graph)
- External orchestration (Claude Code as long-task tool, MLLM image gen for slides)
- Self-evolving agent (APO via human-in-the-loop, not full RLAIF)

---

## Status Glossary

- **Sealed:** Phase complete, friction resolved, accepted partials documented.
- **Functional seal:** Phase deliverables work, but some review-time partials remain tracked.
- **Active:** Currently in execution.
- **Queued:** Planned but not started. Scope may shift based on friction logs.
- **Deferred:** Originally planned, now postponed indefinitely. Re-evaluate when triggered by friction.

## Version

This roadmap is updated only at sprint review seal events, by `chimera-sprint-discipline` skill in review mode, with proposed diffs presented for user confirmation.
